    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Born from passion and perseverance, <strong>Sibs and Stories</strong> is a creation of dedication and hard work. As a cybersecurity student, Im right now mastering the digital world, but my heart has always been rooted in creativity. From a childhood love for the arts to turning my vision into a thriving business, this journey has been nothing short of inspiring.</p>

    <p>What started as a small idea has grown into a small business now, where handcrafted hampers, personalized gifts, and elegant designs come together to create unforgettable experiences. Each piece reflects a story, a sentiment, and a touch of art—the very essence of Sibs and Stories.</p>

    <h2>Join Us on This Journey</h2>
    <p>From humble beginnings to exciting growth, we continue to expand, innovate, and deliver unique gifting experiences. Explore our collection, share in our story, and become a part of our growing family.</p>
